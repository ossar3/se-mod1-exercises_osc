class fridge (brand, color, temperature)

every different instance of a fridge is an object/instance

mini fridge, kitchen silver fridge, oscar's fridge

classes
dogs

or more specific

instances are unique 
 
 class; cup, instance my mug (can't be "mug") instance 1 specific thing

 attributes and behaviors, (fridge)

 behavior: add food, remove_food change temp

 ```ruby
 class NameOfClass

 ```ruby 
 max = Dog.new

 ```
